##  Goy Club Gaming
Goy Club Gaming was founded by Etan Yonas as an outreach for the gentiles NA DotA. Gentiles tend to be extremely embittered easily, and the mere idea of KZZ and Spitwad being Bukhari set off a lot of crocodile tears. 

##  Manifesto 
The GCG manifesto will be exacted in the GCG License, a copywriter's license specifically designed around forums posts and teamspeak chatlogs. Work on the license will be performed for an introductory release coming September 2017. Roadmap forthcoming.
