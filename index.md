##  Goy Club Gaming
Goy Club Gaming was founded by Etan Yonas as an outreach for the gentiles of NA DotA. Gentiles tend to be extremely embittered easily, so a blatant inclusion program was obviated.

##  Manifesto 
The GCG manifesto will be exacted in the GCG License, a copywriter's license specifically designed around forums posts and teamspeak chatlogs. Work on the license will be performed for an introductory release coming September 2017. Roadmap forthcoming.
