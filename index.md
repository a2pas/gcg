##  Goy Club Gaming
Goy Club Gaming was founded by Etan Yonas as an outreach for the gentiles of NA DotA. Gentiles tend to be embitterred extremely easily, so a blatant inclusion program was obviated.

The mission statement(s) of Goy Club Gaming is(are) as follows:
- To enrich the relationship and understanding between Bukharian and Gentile DotA 2 players in North American and elsewhere
- To create a more scholarly environment for NA DotA and her forums
- To be the change you want to see in the forums.

##  Manifesto 
The GCG manifesto will be exacted in the GCG License, a copywriter's license specifically designed around forums posts and teamspeak chatlogs. Work on the license will be performed for an introductory release coming September 2017. Roadmap forthcoming.
